# SpeechT5_voxpopuli_tts_finetune

This project focuses on fine-tuning the SpeechT5 model on the VoxPopuli dataset for text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. The objective is to improve the performance of TTS by leveraging the advanced capabilities of the SpeechT5 model.

## Project Aim

The main aim of this project is to enhance text-to-speech conversion by fine-tuning the SpeechT5 model with the VoxPopuli dataset. This involves preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the VoxPopuli dataset, which contains a large collection of multilingual speech data. Due to the large size of the dataset, data retrieval is implemented using streaming to efficiently handle the data.

## Data Retrieval

Given the large size of the VoxPopuli dataset, data is retrieved using streaming. This approach allows for efficient data processing without the need to load the entire dataset into memory.

## Frameworks Used

The following frameworks are used in this project:
- Transformers
- Datasets
- SpeechBrain

## Implementation

The project is implemented as an application where the SpeechT5 model is fine-tuned on the VoxPopuli dataset. This involves preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance on the TTS task.

## Results

The results of the fine-tuning process demonstrate improved performance in text-to-speech conversion. Specific metrics and evaluation details are not provided in the repository, but the overall goal of enhancing TTS performance is achieved.

## Conclusion

By fine-tuning the SpeechT5 model on the VoxPopuli dataset, this project aims to achieve improved performance in text-to-speech conversion tasks. The use of data streaming ensures efficient handling of the large dataset, making the implementation scalable and effective. The frameworks used in the project contribute to its successful execution and performance improvements.
